## 0x03. ES6 data manipulation
This repository is dedicated to learning and understanding JavaScript ES6, particularly focusing on data manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

- **How to use map, filter and reduce on arrays**: These are powerful higher-order functions that can greatly simplify data manipulation in arrays.
- **Typed arrays**: Typed arrays are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data.
- **The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures**: These ES6 data structures provide different ways to store and manage data. Understanding these structures will help you choose the right tool for your specific needs.

## Resources
- **Array**: The JavaScript Array object is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.
- **Typed Array**: Typed arrays represent an array of a certain binary type in a contiguous block of memory. You can use them for handling binary data.
- **Set Data Structure**: The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.
- **Map Data Structure**: The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
- **WeakMap**: The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. The keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values.

## Requirements
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x: Please ensure that your environment matches these specifications to avoid any compatibility issues.
