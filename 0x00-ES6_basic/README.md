## 0x00. ES6 Basics

This project is about the basics of ES6, a version of JavaScript.

## Concepts

This project will cover the following concepts:

- Modern Javascript

## Learning Objectives

- **What ES6 is**: ES6, or ECMAScript 6, is a version of JavaScript that includes a new set of features and syntax to make the language more powerful and expressive.
- **New features introduced in ES6**: ES6 introduced many new features like let and const, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread operators, template literals, destructuring assignment, and more.
- **The difference between a constant and a variable**: A constant is a value that cannot be altered after it's set, while a variable can be reassigned.
- **Block-scoped variables**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they exist only within the block they're declared in.
- **Arrow functions and function parameters default to them**: Arrow functions are a new syntax for writing JavaScript functions. They are concise and have their own special properties.
- **Rest and spread function parameters**: The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where zero or more arguments for function calls or elements for array literals are expected.
- **String templating in ES6**: Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
- **Object creation and their properties in ES6**: ES6 introduced a new set of rules and syntax for creating objects and defining their properties.
- **Iterators and for-of loops**: An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a collection (like an array or a string). A for-of loop iterates over iterable objects.
