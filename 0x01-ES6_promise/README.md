## 0x01. ES6 Promises
This module covers the concept of Promises in JavaScript ES6.

## Learning Objectives

- **Promises**: A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It serves as a placeholder for the eventual results of the operation.

- **then, resolve, catch methods**: The `then` method is used to schedule callbacks to be called when the Promise is resolved or rejected. The `resolve` method returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. The `catch` method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.

- **Promise object methods**: The Promise object has several methods like `all`, `race`, `allSettled`, `any`, and `reject` which are used to handle multiple promises simultaneously.

- **Throw / Try**: The `throw` statement allows you to create custom errors. It’s often used for testing, and it’s also paired with try...catch within functions. A `try` statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

- **The await operator**: The `await` operator is used to wait for a Promise. It can only be used inside an async function.

- **Async function**: An async function is a function declared with the async keyword. Async functions are instances of the AsyncFunction constructor, and the await keyword is permitted within them.
