## 0x04. TypeScript

This project is about learning and understanding the basics of TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.

## Resources

[TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand and use basic types in TypeScript**: TypeScript includes several data types including boolean, number, string, array, tuple, enum, any, void, null and undefined, never, and object. Understanding these types and how to use them can help ensure variable values are what you expect.
- **Work with interfaces, classes, and functions**: Interfaces in TypeScript are used to tell the compiler what the shape of the JS object should look like. Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code. Functions are the fundamental building block of any application in JavaScript. They’re how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules.
- **Learn how to work with the DOM using TypeScript**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document and allows you to manipulate its content and visual presentation by using a scripting language such as JavaScript.
- **Understand and use generic types**: Generics provide a way to make components work with any data type and not restrict to one data type. So components can be reusable and maintainable.
- **Learn how to use namespaces and merge declarations**: Namespaces are used for grouping related code in TypeScript to avoid collision with other code. Merged declarations allow you to split a single definition across multiple files.
- **Use an ambient namespace to import an external library**: An ambient namespace declaration introduces a new name that can be used as a form of import within other modules.
- **Understand basic nominal typing with TypeScript**: Nominal typing is a system where types are checked based on their names rather than their structures. This is different from structural typing that TypeScript uses by default.

## Requirements

- All files will be transpiled on Ubuntu 18.04.
- TypeScript scripts will be checked with jest (version 24.9.x).
